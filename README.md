# boolean_classifier_for_c4gt

This is simple boolean classifier training using T5.
I have trained this using dataset collected by ramsrigouthamg.
I made this project as a starting point for Code for Govtech(C4GT).
This is inspired from https://github.com/ramsrigouthamg/generate_boolean_questions_using_T5_transformer
He has awesome question generation toolkit checkout if you want.
